# Understand and evaluate Microsoft Identity Manager
This section provides content to help you learn about Microsoft Identity Manager.

## [What is Microsoft Identity Manager 2016?](microsoft-identity-manager-2016.md)
Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2016 is the latest version of Microsoft’s Identity and Access management (IAM) product suite, and replaces Forefront Identity Manager (FIM) 2010 R2. MIM provides identity data management and synchronization, authentication and authorization workflows, and self-service identity management capabilities for end-users – group management, credentials management, certificate management, etc.

## [Hybrid Reporting in Azure](identity-manager-hybrid-reporting-azure.md)
If you use both Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Identity Manager, you get a lot of data reporting from activities across your entire environment, from on-premises to the cloud. See how Identity Manager Hybrid Reporting consolidates this information into a unified report for all your identity management data.
