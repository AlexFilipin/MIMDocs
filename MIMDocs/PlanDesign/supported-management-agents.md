# Supported connectors in MIM 2016

Connectors link specific connected data sources to Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM). A connector moves data from a connected data source to MIM. When data in MIM is modified, the connector can also export the data to the connected data source to keep it synchronized with MIM. Generally, there is at least one connector for each connected directory.

There are two types of connectors:
- **Call-based connectors** use an API function call to a data source to import or export data.

- **File-based connectors** use a text file to import data from and export data to a connected data source.

This article covers the connectors that are included in MIM, but the connector for Extensible Connectivity 2.0 makes it possible to connect with even more data sources. Some partners have created their own connectors in this way, and a full list is available in the wiki [FIM 2010: Management Agents from Partners](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1589.fim-2010-management-agents-from-partners.aspx).
