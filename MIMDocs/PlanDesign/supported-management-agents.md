# Supported management agents in MIM 2016

Management agents link specific connected data sources to Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM). A management agent is responsible for moving data from a connected data source to MIM. When data in MIM is modified, the management agent can also export the data to the connected data source to keep it synchronized with MIM. Generally, there is at least one management agent for each connected directory.

There are two types of management agents:
- **Call-based management agents** use an API function call to a data source to import or export data.

- **File-based management agents** use a text file to import data from and export data to a connected data source.

This article covers the management agents that are included in MIM, but the Management Agent for Extensible Connectivity 2.0 makes it possible to connect with even more data sources. Some partners have created their own management agents in this way, and a full list is available in the wiki [FIM 2010: Management Agents from Partners](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1589.fim-2010-management-agents-from-partners.aspx).
