# Plan and design
This section provides content to help you plan your Microsoft Identity Manager deployment.

## [Supported platforms](microsoft-identity-manager-2016-supported-platforms.md)
Before you deploy Microsoft Identity Manager, make sure your environment is ready by reviewing the supported platforms for MIM 2016.

## [Capacity planning guide](capacity-planning-guide.md)
Walk through the variables that can affect the overall capacity and performance of your Microsoft Identity Manager deployment. This includes the deployment topology, the hardware you use, as well as the number and complexity of the MIM policy configuration objects, the expected scale of the deployment, as well as the load to be placed on it.

## [Topology considerations](topology-considerations.md)
Topology is the way that you physically deploy the MIM components on your hardware. This article provides some sample topologies, and reviews the performance you can expect from each.
